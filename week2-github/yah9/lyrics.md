I glimpse you now and then
Why not forever more.
Why do clouds engulf my heart?
(Not letting me see
The clouds of illusion blind me
Not letting me see.)

In a sliver of light in the blink of an eye
When I catch a glimpse of you
I am ever fearful of losing you
Only to lose you in a flash.
I lose you before my hopes are met
I lose you before I can blink my eye
I lose you before my heart is soothed
I lose you in a flash.

Tell me how to attain you,
To keep you within my sight
Where will I find so much love oh Lord?
To give you place in my heart
(Can I dare to
If you are not kind who can dare.
If you do not come yourself
Who can keep you in their heart.)

None else, will I look up to
If you command, I will this very moment
With all my heart and soul
Surrender my passions and possessions.
(I will surrender at your feet
I will surrender without hesitation
I will surrender to you my passions and possessions.)
