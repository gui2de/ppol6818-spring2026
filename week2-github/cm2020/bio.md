## Academic interests
Nice to meet you all! My name is Kate, and I am a second-year MPP in the evening program. I look forward to becoming more conversant in the following through this class:
- Data manipulation

- Survey design

## Personal note
On a more personal note, here is a photo from one of the most beautiful places I visited this summer - the Maroon Bells Wilderness in Colorado. I felt lucky to come across a mountain columbine at such a high altitude. If you ever want to go for a long hiking adventure at high altitude, I really recommend the Maroon Bells. You can learn all about it [here](https://www.visitmaroonbells.com/).
