I am Haoyu Shi (石昊宇) and I also go by Harold. I come from Kunming in southwest China, which is named as "Spring City" in Chinese since the weather there is like the spring all year around.\
My falimy has lived in Kunming for generations and we loved our city. We are a large and closed family that usually meet in weekends and holidays to have dinner together.\

### My University & Research Interests

I completed my undergraduate at Tongji University in Shanghai. My major was sociology, which I became deeply interested in, and I am now applying for PhD programs in the field.\
I am particularyly interested in the consequences of modernization in developing countries in sociology. To gain more knowledge about governmental actions in developing countries is also the reason why I came to Georgetown.\

### My Hobbies

I love travelling around during the vacation. Until now, I have been to two thirds of provinces in China, and four countries around the world.\
In daily lives, I like boxing, painting, and writing. Although it's physically exhausted, boxing usually gives me a sense of peace in mind after training.\
