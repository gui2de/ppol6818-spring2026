lyrices:

Does no one know
Who they're dealing with?
Think I'll let it go?
Forget and forgive?

The rage in me
Is terminal
There's no remedy
But to...

Burn 'em all 

I still got a job to do
My mission's incomplete
Only a traitor could consider making peace 

The princess has to pay
For what she did that day
For what she took away!

Storm's comin'
I can see the clouds
No runnin's gonna save you now!
And hard rain is gonna fall down like gravity
Like gravity!

Eye for an eye says you owe me a debt!
Blood demands blood, gonna get my hands wet!

The flood's comin', now you can bet on tragedy
Like gravity!

You think you're Hell's great savior? 
Will you still when I return the favor?
Take the one you need
Make you watch 'em bleed (Vindictus)
Will you break thinking how you couldn't save her?!

Wishin' you were there when they needed you
The only soul who's ever completed you
Maybe then you'll get a little heated too
And understand why this is what I need to do!

Storm's comin', I can see the clouds

No runnin's gonna save you now
And hard rain is gonna fall down like gravity
Like gravity!

Eye for an eye says
You owe me a debt!

Blood demands blood, gonna get my hands wet!

The flood's comin', now you can bet on tragedy
Like gravity!
