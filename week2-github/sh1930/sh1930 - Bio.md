## Academic and Professional Background 
I am a second year MPP student at Georgetown's McCourt School of Public Policy. Before joining the school, I was based in London working in the civil service, which is also the city where I completed my undergraduate studies in International Relations.

## Policy Interests
My policy area of interest and focus is political economy. I have worked in the following areas that have contributed to this interest:

- International public-private partnerships for government infrastructure projects 
- Understanding the supply and demand of digital skills in the labor market
