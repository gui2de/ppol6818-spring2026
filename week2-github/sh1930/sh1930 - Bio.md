# Sunduss Hamdan's Bio

## Academic and Professional Background 
I am a second year MPP student at Georgetown's McCourt School of Public Policy. Before joining the school, I was based in London working in the civil service, which is also the city where I completed my undergraduate studies in International Relations. I don't have a favourite part of London because I'm an indecisive person when it comes to these things, but I will say if it's your first time, walking to and from each classic monument (e.g., big ben, london eye, buckingham palace, the parks etc.) in central on a sunny day with a hot drink in hand never gets old :)

## Policy Interests
My policy area of interest and focus is political economy. I have worked in the following areas that have contributed to this interest: 

- Trade agreement negotiations 
- International public-private partnerships for government infrastructure projects 
- Understanding the supply and demand of digital skills in the labor market

## Other 
I would love to have a cat so here is a picture of a cute kitten I saw sleeping on the window sill at a cat cafe in Georgetown :)
