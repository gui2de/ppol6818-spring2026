# Stephanie Petrov Biography

## Research Background

Hi all! My name is Stephanie Petrov and I am a second year MPP-EP student at McCourt.  
I work full-time at the Urban Institute, a nonprofit policy research organization, as a research analyst.  

My research interests include:
* postsecondary education
* workforce development
* student basic needs support. 
[Here](https://www.urban.org/author/stephanie-petrov) is some of my work. I mainly work on qualitative research projects, so I'm pretty excited to improve my quantitative analysis skills during this course. 

I'm looking forward to meeting + working with you all this semester.

# Fun Facts

* I'm a big fan of indie music and I like going to concerts. My favorite DC venue is 9:30 Club.  
* I also really enjoy reading and cooking. I read all sorts of things - novels, nonfiction, essay collections, short stories, magazines, and poetry. Some of my favorite authors of all time are Kurt Vonnegut, Joan Didion, and Eve Babitz. I'm a big fan of the DC Public Library (if you don't already have a library card, you should get one -- let me know if you need help where to look) and love to browse local bookstores. Lost City Books in Adams Morgan, Kramers in Dupont Circle, and Capital Hill Books are some of my favorites. 
* I recently bought an espresso machine and have been trying to learn latte art. It hasn't been going too well... if you have any tips, let me know!
