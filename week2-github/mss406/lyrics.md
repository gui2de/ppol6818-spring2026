Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

The morning light is turning blue, the feeling is bizarre (bizarre)
The night is almost over, I still don't know where you are
The shadows, yeah, they keep me pretty like a movie star
Daylight makes me feel like Dracula (Dracula)
In the end, I hope it's you and me
In the darkness, I would never leave you (ah)
Won't ever see me in the light of day
It's far too late, the time has come
I'm on the verge of caving in, I run back to the dark
Now I'm Mr. Charisma, fucking Pablo Escobar (Escobar)
My friends are saying, "Shut up, Kevin, just get in the car" (Kevin)
I just wanna be right where you are (oh, my love)
In the end, I hope it's you and me
In the darkness, I would never leave (I won't leave her)
We both saw this moment coming from afar
Now here we are
Run from the sunlight, Dracula (hey)
Run from the sunlight, Dracula (Dracu-Dracula)
Run from the sunlight, Dracula (run from the sun)
Isn't the view spectacular? (sunlight, Dracula)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh (check it out now)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
But please, do you think about what it might mean?
'Cause I dream about you in my sleep
Would you ever love someone like me? Like me? (Oh)
In the end, I hope it's you and me (oh)
In the darkness, I would never leave (I won't leave her)
We both saw this moment comin' from afar
Now here we are
So run from the sunlight, Dracula (hey)
Run from the sunlight, Dracula (run from the sunlight, Dracula)
Run from the sunlight, Dracula (oh)
Isn't the view spectacular? (run from the sunlight, Dracula)
Run from the sunlight, Dracula (run from the sunlight, Dracula)
Run from the sunlight, Dracula (run from the sunlight)
Isn't the view spectacular? (run from the sunlight, Dracula)
Run from the sunlight, Dracula (run from the sunlight, Dracula)
Run from the sunlight, Dracula (run from the sunlight, Dracula)
Isn't the view spectacular?
