# Fabiha's Big Beautiful Bio 

### Dearest Gentle Reader, 
My name is Fabiha Moin and I am first year MIDP student from Karachi city in Pakistan. Since Karachi is a big part of my identity, I am going to tell you some actual facts about the city and some hills that I will die on. So here it goes: 

#### Karachi 101 by Fabiha 

* Karachi is the third most unlivable city in the world according to the Economic Intelligence Unit at the Economist -- yet I managed to live there for about 25 years so you know my survival skills are great 
* In terms of population, Karachi is about 29 times bigger than Washington DC -- which is why DC alienates me 
* *The first hill the I will die on*: Karachi has THE BEST food in the entire Pakistan 
* *The second hill that I will die on*: Karachi also has one of the prettiest sunsets in Pakistan 

Anyways, enough about Karachi, here is a picture of me taking a nap when I should have started investing in stocks and bitcoins:

And here's a cool The Economist article on Jane Austen's economic commentary through her work that I think is worth your 15 minutes: [How Jane Austen Revealed the Economic Basis of Society] (https://www.economist.com/christmas-specials/2025/12/12/how-jane-austen-revealed-the-economic-basis-of-society)
