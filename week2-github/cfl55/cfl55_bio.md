### Felicity's Top 10 Favorite Smells

- ***Oranges and cinnamon***, preferably warm and wafting through my house in the morning.
- ***Toaster waffles and sticky maple syrup*** because it reminds me of my Grandpa, who could toast a frozen hockey puck and drizzle it with the actual perfect amount of syrup and turn it straight into Heaven on a paper plate.
- ***Freshly done laundry at someone else's house***. Like when you can smell it as you walk by on a chilly evening. Other people’s laundry smells better than your own. Or maybe that’s just true when you buy the cheapest detergent. 
- ***A random man's cologne***. This is true often, but particularly when I passed two guys when leaving a restaurant with my brother and my boyfriend (now husband) in 2021. To be clear, my husband and my brother were not the two guys.
- ***Indian food wafting outside of an apartment on the first floor of my building two weeks ago***. I really wanted to ask if I could join them for dinner, but felt that would be inappropriate. 
- ***Campfire smoke***. I love this smell, and I know you probably think it’s gross, but this is my list.
- ***Babies***, obviously.
- ***Lemons***. Probably not actual lemons, but the lemony scent of lemon flavored candy or a particular kind of hand soap. Sharp and tingly and citrusy.
- ***Really yeasty bread***. Straight out of the oven or left out to form a thick, chewy crust. Smells like I imagine Europe should smell.
- ***Justice***. Because I think it will help get me into law school.
