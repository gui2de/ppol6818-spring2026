## Lyrics

I see trees of green <br>
Red roses too <br>
I see them bloom <br>
For me and you <br>
And I think to myself <br>
What a wonderful world <br>

I see skies of blue <br>
And clouds of white <br>
The bright blessed day <br>
The dark sacred night <br>
And I think to myself <br>
What a wonderful world

The colors of the rainbow <br>
So pretty in the sky <br>
Are also on the faces <br>
Of people going by <br>
I see friends shaking hands <br>
Saying, "How do you do?" <br>
They're really saying <br>
I love you



I hear babies cry <br>
I watch them grow <br>
They'll learn much more <br>
Than I'll ever know <br>
And I think to myself <br>
What a wonderful world <br>
Yes, I think to myself <br>
What a wonderful world <br>
Ooh, yes
