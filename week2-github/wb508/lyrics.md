Transport, motorways, and tramlines
Starting and then stopping, taking off and landing
The emptiest of feelings, disappointed people
Clinging onto bottles
When it comes, it's so, so disappointing

Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around

Shell smashed, juices flowing, wings twitch
Legs are going, don't get sentimental
It always ends up drivel
One day, I am gonna grow wings
A chemical reaction
Hysterical and useless, hysterical and

Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around

Let down and hang
Let down and hang
Let down and hang

You know, you know where you are with
You know where you are with
Floor collapses, floating
Bouncing back

And one day, I am gonna grow wings
A chemical reaction (you know where you are)
Hysterical and useless (you know where you are)
Hysterical and (you know where you are)

Let down, and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down, and hanging around
