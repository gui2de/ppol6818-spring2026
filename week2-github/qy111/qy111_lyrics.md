## The lyrics of my favorite song.
Yankee Doodle went to town,
A-riding on a pony,
Stuck a feather in his cap
And called it macaroni.

Yankee Doodle, keep it up,
Yankee Doodle dandy,
Mind the music and the step,
And with the girls be handy.

Father and I went down to camp
Along with Captain Gooding,
And there we saw the men and boys
As thick as hasty pudding.

There was Captain Washington
Upon a slapping stallion,
A-giving orders to his men,
I guess there was a million.

And there I saw a little keg,
Its heads were made of leather,
They knocked upon it with little clubs
And called the folks together.
