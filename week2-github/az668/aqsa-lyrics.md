# Favourite (English) Song Lyrics

You sit there in your heartache<br>
Waiting on some beautiful boy to<br>
To save you from your old ways<br>
You play forgiveness<br>
Watch it now, here he comes<br>

He doesn't look a thing like Jesus<br>
But he talks like a gentlemen<br>
Like you imagined when you were young<br>

Can we climb this mountain?<br>
I don't know<br>
Higher now than ever before<br>
I know we can make it if we take it slow<br>
Let's take it easy<br>
Easy now, watch it go<br>

We're burning down the highway skyline<br>
On the back of a hurricane that started turning<br>
When you were young<br>
When you were young<br>

And sometimes you close your eyes<br>
And see the place where you used to live<br>
When you were young<br>

They say the devil's water, it ain't so sweet<br>
You don't have to drink right now<br>
But you can dip your feet<br>
Every once in a little while<br>

You sit there in your heartache<br>
Waiting on some beautiful boy to<br>
To save you from your old ways<br>
You play forgiveness<br>
Watch it now, here he comes<br>

He doesn't look a thing like Jesus<br>
But he talks like a gentlemen<br>
Like you imagined when you were young<br>
(Talks like a gentlemen, like you imagined)<br>
When you were young<br>

I said he doesn't look a thing like Jesus<br>
He doesn't look a thing like Jesus<br>
But more than you'll ever know<br>
