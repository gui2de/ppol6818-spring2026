## Background

Hey, I am Anu. I’m a second-year MPP student from India. Before focusing on policy, I was a product engineer (who started coding at 14) turned program manager. I have worked across multiple MNCs and unicorn startups. Through these experiences, I have come to realize that real change requires not only creating products but also establishing clear guidelines for how to develop and utilize them.
