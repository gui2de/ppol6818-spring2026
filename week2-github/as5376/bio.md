## Background

Hey, I am Anu. I’m a second-year MPP student from India. Before focusing on policy, I was a product engineer (who started coding at 14) turned program manager. I have worked across multiple MNCs and unicorn startups. My transition from engineering to public policy was motivated by a growing realization that technical solutions alone cannot address complex social and environmental challenges without supportive institutions, incentives, and governance frameworks.
This shift has shaped my interest in policy problems at the intersection of climate action, environmental justice, technology governance, and social welfare—areas where evidence-based analysis must be paired with political and institutional feasibility.

The place that has most influenced how I think about policy and social change is living between India and EU. Growing up and working in India grounded my understanding of inequality, informality, and the local realities of policy implementation, while engaging in policy spaces in Europe exposed me to global governance, international negotiations, and the power-and limits-of institutions. Experiencing both contexts has made me especially attentive to how international agreements and national policies translate unevenly at the local level, and why comparative, context-sensitive policymaking matters.
