The sun goes down
The stars come out 
And all that counts
Is here and now 
My universe will never be the same 
I'm glad you came

You cast your spell on me, spell on me 
You hit me like the sky fell on me, fell on me 
So I decided you look well on me, well on me 
So let's go somewhere no one else can see, you and me

Turn the lights out NOW 
NOW I'll take you by the HAND
HAND you another DRINK
DRINK it if you CAN
CAN you spend a little TIME
TIME is slipping AWAY
AWAY from us so STAY
STAY with me I can MAKE
Make you GLAD YOU CAME

(Repeat all three verses two more times and then end with first verse in a slower cadence)

//This is the only song whose lyrics I know fully - hopefully I got it all correct!
