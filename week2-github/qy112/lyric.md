# Lyrics

*This is a Chinese song, and I made an English translation.*

像孩子那样哭着闹着\
Cry like a child, laugh and cry out loud

像大人那样安静沉稳的\
Stay calm and steady, like a grown-up now

活得高亢 低落 高亢 低落\
Living with highs and lows, again and again

有个沙漏在心中荡呀\
An hourglass swings in my heart

默许时间让皱纹蔓延了\
I let time leave its lines on me

对在意的事手也握紧了\
Hold on tighter to the things I care about

不愿得过且过 可无可有\
Won't just drift along, like nothing matters

不是命运 这是我最深爱的\
It's not just fate, it's what I love the most

------------------------------------------------------------------------

时间啊 来吧\
Time, come on, bring it on

再重来一次我都会\
If I did it all again, I still would

没有明天般挥霍着\
Spending my days like tomorrow won't come

找到你 时间啊 走吧\
I'll find you, so time, keep moving on

我依然还是那个她\
I'm still the same me, the girl you knew

没有明天地去爱着\
Loving like there's no tomorrow left

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Forever young\
Forever young

学着遥望 手却不会放\
Learning to look ahead, but I won't let go

我多骄傲 这是我的骨架 我的内脏\
I'm proud of who I am, my bones and blood

对吗? 你深爱着那样的我对吗?\
Right? You love me like this, as I am, right?

遇到每个女孩我都会告诉她\
Every girl I meet, I always tell her

你该那样爱上\
You should learn to love like that, with all you have

Forever young\
Forever young
