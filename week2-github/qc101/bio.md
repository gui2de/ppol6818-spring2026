My name is Qingyue Chen (Iris), and my pronouns are she/her/hers. I am a second-year Master of Public Policy (MPP) student at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy. My academic concentration is in Environmental and Energy Policy, where I focus on sustainability, governance, and data-driven decision-making.
