I hold you through the toughest parts  
When you feel like it's the end  
And every night you fall apart  
I'll stay with you again  

You say the world is cold and cruel  
That love is never kind  
But in the quiet of your room  
I keep you in my mind  

When all your dreams feel far away  
And darkness fills the air  
You call my name in muted ways  
And I am always there  

I see you standing on the edge  
Afraid to take the leap  
But I will catch you if you fall  
And guide you while you sleep
