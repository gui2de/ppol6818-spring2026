# About Me
Hello! My name is Arishka, I'm from Mumbai, India. I can speak 5 languages--English, Konkani, Hindi, Marathi, Mandarin/Chinese. In my free time, I really enjoy painting, reading novels (romantic comedies are my favorite genre) and watching new sitcoms. I'm also competitive about card/board games (there no thing such as mercy in UNO, sorry), have a witty sense of humour, and definitely LOVE listening to new stories--either about people, places or things. Here are some other things about me: 

# What Keeps Me Busy
## Academic Interests/Activities
* Education Policy and State Capacity Building 
* Interdisciplinary Learning--I did two minors in International Relations and Political Science in my Undergrad
* Coding: Even though it's very frustrating at times, I really like to code and discover new tricks to make things work. 

## Non-Academic Interests/Activities
* Watching Sitcoms, Law/Crime-solving shows and Korean Dramas (I'm currently watching [Franklin & Bash](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1600199/); an ongoing K-Drama called [Spring Fever](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt39137681/) and [Good Cop/Bad Cop](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt31691565/)).

* Travelling--I've currently been to three international countries and four Indian States! 

* Playing badminton and volleyball!

* Cooking/Finding new places to eat (I'm a BIG foodie, new cuisines, restaurants are my jam).

For my summer internship, I am planning to work in field evaluations within the education sector--currently I am in the process of emailing professors and academics for opportunities to chat and explore this further.
