## Some of the most important personal things to know about me are:

+ In no particular order, I am a lover of plants, the sun, the planet, quality cookware, public education, coffee, good food, cats, public transportation, and the color orange.
+ I am a first-generation Pakistani-American and first-generation college graduate & master's student from Southern California.
+ In my free time, you can find me experimenting with a new recipe, playing with my cat Godric, or tending to my plants!
+ One of my favorite recipes is Samin Nosrat's [Persian-ish Rice](https://www.saltfatacidheat.com/heat/pavo-en-escabeche). It makes an incredible tahdig, and I can serve it with almost anything. Her cookbooks "Salt Fat Acid Heat" and "Good Things" are some of my favorite posessions and both are very, very worn.

## Some of the most important professional things to know about me are:

+ I am a first-year MIDP student, and I am interested in the areas of environmental resilience (particularly food systems) and public education.
+ I taught high school at [Abramson Sci Academy](https://asa.collegiateacademies.org/about/mission-values) in New Orleans, LA for 4 years.
+ I got my undergraduate degree in International Development from GW!

See you in class!
