## Background

I am a second-year MPP student with an interest in social inequality and international development. 

I grew up in Yichang, China, about 300 kilometers from Wuhan, where I later attended university in 2020. My undergraduate years coincided with an extended period of campus closures and social isolation, which reshaped both my daily life and academic experience.

During those years, daily life became smaller and quieter, and long-term plans often felt uncertain. Studying and living through that period taught me how to adapt, stay focused, and keep moving forward even when circumstances were beyond my control. With limited mobility and resources, I learned to rely more on self-directed learning, research, and reflection. Those experiences gradually shaped my interest in understanding how policies affect people’s lives under constraint, especially those with fewer choices or less protection.

Looking back, that period did not define what I could do, but it strongly influenced how I think — about resilience, inequality, and the importance of evidence-based policy in difficult contexts.

## Master’s Studies

### Coursework & Skills
During my master’s studies at the McCourt School of Public Policy, I focus on quantitative policy analysis, including statistics, econometrics, data science, and GIS. My coursework emphasizes working with real-world datasets and using empirical evidence to analyze policy questions related to inequality and development.

### Research Experience
Alongside coursework, I have worked as a research assistant on projects related to international trade and political economy. My work mainly involves data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using tools such as Stata, R, and Python, as well as contributing to reproducible research outputs.

### Professional Exposure
I have also gained applied policy experience through internships, including work at the World Bank Group DECIG Business Ready Project and with a nonprofit focused on school organic food systems. 

### Focus Going Forward
Overall, my master’s training combines analytical rigor with applied research, and I am interested in using data-driven approaches to address social inequality and international development challenges.
