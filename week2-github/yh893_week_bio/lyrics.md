# Lyrics

She's faced the hardest times you could imagine

And many times her eyes fought back the tears

And when her youthful world was about to fall in

Each time her slander shoulders

Bore the weight of all her fears

And a sorrow no one hears till rings

in mid-night silence in her ears

Let her cry for she's a lady

Let her dream for she's a child

Let the rain fall down upon her

She's a free and gentle flower growing wild
