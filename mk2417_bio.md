# My Bio 

## Introduction

I am a Fulbright Scholar currently pursuing a Master’s in International Development Policy, deeply committed to serving refugees and marginalized communities. Growing up in Peshawar, a region that has long been a refuge for displaced populations, I witnessed firsthand the challenges faced by those forced to rebuild their lives. This exposure, coupled with my early experiences assisting refugees and advocating for sustainable solutions, shaped my passion for humanitarian work, policy-driven impact, and climate resilience.

My academic and professional journey has been dedicated to creating meaningful change through research, advocacy, and development initiatives. As a Research Assistant, I have worked on health and education service delivery for refugees and marginalized communities, gaining firsthand insight into the structural challenges they face. Beyond research, I have led community-driven projects focused on education, youth empowerment, and climate action. I strongly believe in the transformative power of education and its role in breaking cycles of poverty and displacement. My work focuses on developing evidence-based policies that expand access to quality education and healthcare for displaced populations, integrate climate resilience into development strategies, and create sustainable solutions that empower refugees to build secure and self-sufficient futures.
